        This AMP builds a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)
        Question-Answer Large Language Model (LLM) Bot application which
        demonstrates how context from local documents can be used with pre-trained
        LLM models to perform context retrieval and chat response
        generation with factual responses.
