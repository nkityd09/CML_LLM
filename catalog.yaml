     label: churn-prediction
     short_description: Build an scikit-learn model to predict churn using customer telco data.
     long_description: >-
     This project demonstrates how to build a logistic regression classification model to predict the probability 
     that a group of customers will churn from a fictitious telecommunications company. In addition, the model is 
     interpreted using a technique called Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME). Both the logistic 
     regression and LIME models are deployed using CML's real-time model deployment capability and interact with a 
     basic Flask-based web application.
