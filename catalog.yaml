    short_description: A demonstration of how the NLP task of text style transfer can be applied to enhance the human writing experience using HuggingFace Transformers and Streamlit.
    long_description: >-
      The goal of this application is to demonstrate how the NLP task of text style transfer can be applied to enhance the human writing experience. In this sense, 
      we intend to peel back the curtains on how an intelligent writing assistant might function â€” walking through the logical steps needed to automatically re-style a piece of text 
      (from informal-to-formal or subjective-to-neutral) while building up confidence in the model output.
